### Packer ðŸ“¦
This repo is means to replicate JS bundlers (like webpack) in a very simple way to understand how they work on a high level.

#### Usage:

- Make sure you `npm link` the two packages: `packer` and `packer-cli` first to your app.
- Create a `packer.config.js` in your app you want to bundle.
  
  ```
  module.exports = {
    entry: './src/index.js',
    output: {
        filename: 'index.js'
    }
  };
  ```

- Add a build command to your app package.json.
  
  ```
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "build": "pckr --config packer.config.js"
  },
  ```
  
- Run `npm run build` and this will create a `/build` directory in your app root with the bundled file :D
